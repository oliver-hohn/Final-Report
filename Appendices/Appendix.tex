Published on the 20th of January 2017. URL: http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-35318432}, captionpos=t]
Long before he was a contender for the US presidency, Donald Trump was America's most famous and colourful billionaire. 
Once considered a long shot, Trump is now president of the United States. 
Scepticism over Trump's candidacy stemmed not only from his controversial platform on immigration and outrageous campaign style, but from his celebrity past. 
But the 70-year-old businessman had the last laugh when he defied all predictions to beat much more seasoned politicians in the Republican primary race. 
And he has now gone a step further by winning the presidential election, after one of the most divisive and controversial contests in living memory against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. 
 
Early life 
Mr Trump is the fourth child of New York real estate tycoon Fred Trump. Despite the family's wealth, he was expected to work the lowest-tier jobs within his father's company and was sent off to a military academy at age 13 when he started misbehaving in school. 
He attended the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and became the favourite to succeed his father after his older brother, Fred, chose to become a pilot. 
Fred Trump died at 43 due to alcoholism, an incident that his brother saysled him to avoid alcohol and cigarettes his entire life. 
Mr Trump says he got into real estate with a "small" \$1m loan from his father before joining the company. He helped manage his father's extensive portfolio of residential housing projects in the New York City boroughs, and took control of the company - which he renamed the Trump Organization - in 1971. 
His father died in 1999. "My father was my inspiration," Mr Trump said at the time. 
 
The mogul 
Mr Trump shifted his family's business from residential units in Brooklyn and Queens to glitzy Manhattan projects, transforming the rundown Commodore Hotel into the Grand Hyatt and erecting the most famous Trump property, the 68-storey Trump 
Tower on Fifth Avenue. Other properties bearing the famous name followed - Trump Place, Trump World Tower, Trump International Hotel and Tower, and so on. There are Trump Towers in Mumbai, Istanbul and the Philippines. 
Mr Trump also developed hotels and casinos, an arm of the business that has led to four bankruptcy filings (for the businesses, not personal bankruptcy). 
Mr Trump also built an empire in the entertainment business. From 1996 until 2015, he was an owner in the Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA beauty pageants. In 2003, he debuted an NBC reality television show called The Apprentice, in which contestants competed for a shot at a management job within Mr Trump's organisation. He hosted the show for 14 seasons, and claimed in a financial disclosure form that he was paid a total of \$213m by the network during the show's run. 
He has written several books, and owns a line of merchandise that sells everything from neckties to bottled water. According to Forbes, his net worth is \$3.7bn, though Mr Trump has repeatedly insisted he is worth \$10bn. 
 
The husband and father 
Trump has been married three times, though his most famous wife was his first - 
Ivana Zelnickova, a Czech athlete and model. The couple had three children - Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric - before they filed for divorce in 1990. The ensuing court battle made for numerous stories in the tabloid press. Those stories included allegations that Trump was abusive towards Ivana, though she later downplayed the incidents. 
He married actress Marla Maples in 1993. They had a daughter named Tiffany together before divorcing in 1999. He married his current wife Melania Knauss, a model, in 2005, and the couple have one son, Barron William Trump. 
His children from his first marriage now help run Trump Organization, though he is still chief executive. 
 
The candidate
Mr Trump expressed interest in running for president as early as 1987, and even entered the 2000 race as a Reform Party candidate. 
After 2008, he became one of the most outspoken members of the "birther" movement, which questioned whether Barack Obama was born in the US. Those claims have been thoroughly debunked; Mr Obama was born in Hawaii. Mr Trump finally admitted there was no truth in the claims during the presidential race, although, characteristically, there was no apology. 
It was not until June 2015 that Mr Trump formally announced his entrance into the race for the White House. 
"We need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again. We can do that," he said in his announcement speech, promising that as a candidate with no need to fundraise he answered to no special interests and was the perfect outsider candidate. 
Under the banner Make America Great Again, Trump has run a controversial campaign built on promises to strengthen the American economy, build a wall on the border of Mexico and the US, and to temporarily ban immigration by 
Muslims "until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on". 
Despite massive protests at his campaign events and the best efforts of his Republican rivals Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, Trump became the presumptive Republican party nominee for president after the Indiana primary. 
 
The election winner 
Mr Trump's campaign for the presidency was rocked by controversies, including the emergence of a recording from 2005 of him making lewd remarks about women, and claims, including from members of his own party, that he was not fit for office. 
But he consistently told his army of supporters that he would defy the opinion polls, which mostly had him trailing Hillary Clinton, and that his presidency would strike a blow against the political establishment and "drain the swamp" in Washington. 
He took inspiration from the successful campaign to get Britain out of the European Union, saying he would pull off "Brexit times 10". 
It was something few pundits believed would happen as polling day approached, despite his campaign receiving a late boost from fresh controversy over an FBI investigation into his opponent's emails. 
As his stunning victory was still sinking in across the US, his supporters got the chance to see him in the Oval Office when he and President Obama met for transition talks two days after election day. 
He is the first US president never to have held elected office or served in the military, meaning that he had already made history before he was sworn in as America's 45th president on 20 January 2017.

British toddler abducted, police believe 
 
Detectives investigating the disappearance of British girl Madeleine McCann believe she was abducted, Portuguese police revealed today. 
Portugal's Judicial Police - the equivalent of Britain's CID - also said they believe that the three-year-old is still alive. 
Experts have put together a sketch of a suspect, but no further details were revealed for fear of endangering the Leicester youngster's life. 
Madeleine went missing from her family's rented holiday apartment in the Algarve village of Praia Da Luz on Thursday night while her parents, Gerry and Kate, were eating their dinner less than a minute's walk away. 
The couple had been making regular trips back to the apartment from a tapas restaurant opposite to check on Madeleine and their twin son and daughter. 
Police at first launched a missing person hunt, but revealed today that it was now a kidnapping investigation. 
Many elements pointed to an abduction, Guilhermino Encarnacao, director of the Judicial Police in the Faro region, said. Speaking to reporters in the town of Portaimao, he revealed that police had what he described as a suspect. 
Asked what he believed the motive might be, he said that in Portugal, according to the law, "kidnapping" could mean either abducting someone for a ransom or for sexual motives. 
He said police believe Madeleine is still alive and still in Portugal, possibly even still in the Algarve and added that airports in both Portugal and neighbouring Spain had been alerted. 
Yesterday the police received more than 30 calls with possible new lines of inquiry, all of which were being followed up, while calls have flooded in today from all over Portugal from members of the public reporting possible sightings of a girl matching Madeleine's description. 
Asked about reports that one man had claimed to have seen a child with two people, Mr Encarnacao said this was one of the many pieces of information they were investigating. 
He would not go into what specific evidence there was to point to an abduction other than to say that "many elements" suggested that was the case. 
It is not clear whether this means that police are looking for a specific, named individual, or simply someone fitting a description. 
The three-year-old's great uncle, Brian Kennedy, speaking after the police made their announcement, said: "It's a strain. We fear the worst but we are hoping for the best." 
He added that he was in contact with Madeleine's parents, Gerry and Kate, and their wider family in Portugal by phone and through text message and revealed that the family were receiving support from church ministers in Portugal. 
"As far as we know the attention the family have been receiving from the local police and church has been very helpful. It is just a very difficult time. You lose a child for a few minutes and you worry about them. 
Mr Kennedy insisted that Mr and Mrs McCann had acted responsibly when they left the children in the room as they had dinner at a nearby restaurant. 
"The children were left only in the sense that when you put your children to bed you don't stay in the room all night. They had dinner in a restaurant in the complex, only a very short distance away from where the children were, and they kept popping back to check on them, as most parents would. 
"They are highly responsible parents who are devoted to their family. I can only imagine what they are like at the moment."

Madeleine McCann detectives arrive in Portugal to question 11 suspects 

Detectives investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann are expected to begin questioning 11 people on Tuesday. 
British police working on the hunt for the missing girl are thought to have arrived in the Algarve to take part in interviews with individuals who it is thought may have information relating to the case. 
They will spend three days working on the case alongside their Portuguese counterparts, according to reports. 
Scotland Yard has declined to comment, saying it will not provide a “running commentary” on the inquiry. 
The delegation in Portugal is believed to include the incoming head of the British side of the investigation after it emerged last week that the officer who has led Operation Grange since it was launched in 2011 is to step down before Christmas. 
DCI Nicola Wall will replace DCI Andy Redwood, who is to retire, on 22 December. 
Scotland Yard said a handover was taking place and Kate and Gerry McCann, Madeleine’s parents, had been informed of the change. 
British officers spent eight days searching three areas of land in the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz in June, close to where Madeleine disappeared more than seven years ago, but found no new evidence. 
Madeleine, then aged three, disappeared from her holiday apartment on 3 May 2007 as her parents dined at a nearby tapas restaurant with friends. 
Portuguese police closed down their investigation in 2008 but the Met police launched an operation three years later.
