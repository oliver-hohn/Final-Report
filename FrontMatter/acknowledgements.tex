It is usual to thank those individuals who have provided particularly useful assistance, technical or otherwise, during\\ your project. Your supervisor will obviously be pleased to be acknowledged as he or she will have invested quite a lot of time overseeing your progress.
-Acknowledge Supervisor, Friends \& Family
I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Jeroen Keppens. The supervision and support he provided was extremely helpful throughout the progression of the project. Also I would like to thank my family and friends for the continued support and encouragement throughout the project. I could have not done it without them.
