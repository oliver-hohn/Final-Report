I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Jeroen Keppens, and King's College London. The supervision and support Dr. Keppens provided was extremely helpful throughout the progression of the project. Also, I would like to thank my family and friends for the continued support and encouragement throughout the project. I could have not done it without them.
